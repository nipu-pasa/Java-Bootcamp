* Identify if you can break down problem into smaller problem
* Write the recurrence relation (if needed)
* Draw the recursive tree
* About the tree:
                See the flow of function,how they are getting in the stack
* Identify and focus on the left tree calls and right tree calls
* Draw the tree and pointers again and again using pen and paper (Very Important)
* Use a debugger to see the flow of the program
* See how the values and what type of values like int,str,float are return to the step.
* See where the function call will come out of
* In the end you will come out of the main function
